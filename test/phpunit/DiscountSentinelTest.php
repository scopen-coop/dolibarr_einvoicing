 *      \brief      PHPUnit test for the four sentinels a discount line carries.
 *                  A discount built from another piece has no text of its own: the core stores
 *                  '(CREDIT_NOTE)', '(DEPOSIT)', '(EXCESS RECEIVED)' or '(EXCESS PAID)' in its
 *                  description and resolves it at print time. An e-invoice that does not resolve it
 *                  shows the sentinel to the customer, in the item name of a line (BT-153) or in the
 *                  reason of a document level allowance (BT-97).
 *      \remarks    To run this script as CLI: phpunit filename.php
